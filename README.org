* Abstract

This is a [[https://github.com/n8han/giter8][giter8]] template for removing the boilerplate in setting up a new scala project:

It is a variation from [[https://github.com/spray/spray-template/tree/on_spray-can_1.3][spray-can-1.3]], using scalatest and logback groovy configuration.

- `main` and `test` source directories and stubs
- [[http://www.scalatest.org/][scalatest]]
- SBT simple confguration for `0.13`, scala `2.10.X` as default, `logback` and `scalatest` dependencies
- project `name`, `organization`, `version` ,` scalaVersion`  and dependencies versions are customizable as variables
- everything in your project's base package imported automatically in repl sessions
